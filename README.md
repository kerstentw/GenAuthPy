# Generic Auth

This is a generic authentication system for SQL.  It can be swapped with higher
level ORM's for greater access for creating unique relationships.  It is not
meant to be fully functional and will be updated over time for modularity.  

This codebase is meant as a training and research tool and not meant to be
put into production without *heavy* modification.
